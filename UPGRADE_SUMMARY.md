## What's New in Java 21

Java 21 is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release that includes:

### Key Features
1. **Virtual Threads (JEP 444)** - Lightweight threads for improved concurrency
2. **Sequenced Collections (JEP 431)** - New collection interfaces with defined encounter order
3. **Record Patterns (JEP 440)** - Pattern matching for record classes
4. **Pattern Matching for switch (JEP 441)** - Enhanced switch expressions
5. **String Templates (Preview - JEP 430)** - Simplified string composition
6. **Unnamed Patterns and Variables (Preview - JEP 443)** - Improved code readability
7. **Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview - JEP 445)** - Simplified entry points

### Performance Improvements
- Enhanced garbage collection
- Improved startup time
- Better memory efficiency
- Optimized runtime performance

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions
1. **Update CI/CD Pipeline**: Ensure Jenkins uses JDK 21
   - Update the `myJDK` tool configuration in Jenkins to point to JDK 21
   
2. **Review Dependencies**: Consider updating dependencies to leverage Java 21 features
   - Check for newer versions compatible with Java 21
   - Review security advisories

3. **Code Modernization**: Consider adopting Java 21 features:
   - Use Virtual Threads for concurrent operations
   - Leverage Pattern Matching for cleaner code
   - Utilize Sequenced Collections where appropriate

4. **Docker Build**: Rebuild Docker images with the updated Dockerfile
   ```bash
   docker build -t jenkins-maven-project:java21 .
   ```

5. **Testing**: Perform comprehensive testing in staging environment
   - Integration tests
   - Performance tests
   - Load tests

## Compatibility Notes

### Maven Compiler Plugin Warning
The build shows a warning about using `--release 21` instead of `-source 21 -target 21`.
This is optional but recommended for better compatibility. To implement:

```xml
<configuration>
    <release>21</release>
</configuration>
```

### Dependencies Compatibility
All current dependencies are compatible with Java 21:
- Spark Java 2.9.4: ✅ Compatible
- SLF4J 2.0.9: ✅ Compatible
- JUnit 4.13.2: ✅ Compatible

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback by reverting:
1. `pom.xml`: Change versions back to `11`
2. `Dockerfile`: Revert base images to Java 11
3. Rebuild with: `mvn clean package`
